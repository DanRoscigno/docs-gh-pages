# Using Seeds

dbt provides the ability to load data from CSV files. This capability is not suited to loading large exports of a database and is more designed for small files typically used for code tables and [dictionaries](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/dictionaries/), e.g. mapping country codes to country names. For a simple example, we generate and then upload a list of genre codes using the seed functionality.

1. We generate a list of genre codes from our existing dataset. From the dbt directory, use the `clickhouse-client` to create a file `seeds/genre_codes.csv`:

    ```bash
    clickhouse-user@clickhouse:~/imdb$ clickhouse-client --password <password> --query
    "SELECT genre, ucase(substring(genre, 1, 3)) as code FROM imdb.genres GROUP BY genre
    LIMIT 100 FORMAT CSVWithNames" > seeds/genre_codes.csv
    ```

2. Execute the `dbt seed` command. This will create a new table `genre_codes` in our database `imdb_dbt` (as defined by our schema configuration) with the rows from our csv file.

    ```bash
    clickhouse-user@clickhouse:~/imdb$ dbt seed

    ```
3. Confirm these have been loaded:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM imdb_dbt.genre_codes LIMIT 10;
    ```
